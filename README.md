### ETL Task Instructions

This script addresses the ETL task instructions for the MissionWired skill test. 

In order to run the code, a requirements.txt file is included. While the code should be compliant with any version of Python 3.6 or up, I recommend creating a virtual environment and installing the requirements before running the script. The script can be run in the command line as follows: `python etl_task.py`. No additional command-line arguments or user editing of the file is necessary.
